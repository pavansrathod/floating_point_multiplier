# floating_point_multiplier
The goal of the "Floating Point Multiplier" project is to design and implement a system that accurately multiplies two floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754 standards.

The process involves parsing inputs, multiplying mantissas, adding exponents, normalizing results, handling overflow/underflow, determining the sign, and formatting the final floating-point result.

Features include parsing inputs, multiplying mantissas, adding exponents, normalizing results, handling overflow/underflow, calculating signs, and formatting the output in floating-point representation.
